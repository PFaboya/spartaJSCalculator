# sparta JS Calculator

## Summary

The task was to set up a calculator using the prompt function in Javascript in order to make basic calculations i.e additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions. as well as more complex calculations like power and square root. As a bonus I was able to add a BMI calculator for both imperial and metric units.
